# Programming Ability Test


Start from January 4, 2017

Basic Level (中文).

Over on February 15, 2017

The 65 problems at Basic Level are all clear.

A good thing.

I will not do this-like practice in some time.

But what I will code has not been decided.

Hope I'll make a decision as soon as possible.

Have a good time, everyone.
