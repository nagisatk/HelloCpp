Some Exercise Codes for learning C++

I use the book *Essential C++* for learning C++.

But unfortunately because of some unexpected accidents,
my codes of chapter 1 and chapter 2 were lost and can't be taken back.

So those codes start from Exercise 2.x.

Though I didnot make a clear index/some accurate titles.
